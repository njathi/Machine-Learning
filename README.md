ðŸŒž Solar Energy Prediction Model

Objective:

To develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts Global Tilted Irradiance (GTI Clean), a key indicator of solar energy potential, using weather and temporal data.

ðŸ”§ Methodology

Model Type: Supervised Regression (Random Forest Regressor)

Dataset: Historical weather and irradiance measurements

Target Variable: gti_clean (W/mÂ²)

Input Features:

Weather data: ghi_pyr_1, ghi_pyr_2, dhi_pyr, air_temperature, humidity, wind_speed, etc.
Engineered time features: hour_sin, dayofyear_cos, etc.

ðŸ“ˆ Performance Metrics
| Metric   | Value     | Interpretation                                |
| -------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| MAE      | 8.64 W/mÂ² | Average prediction error                      |
| RMSE     | 17.74 W/mÂ²| Penalizes larger errors                       |
| RÂ² Score | 0.9975    | Explains 99.75% of the variance in GTI values |

The model demonstrates high accuracy, with predictions closely aligned to actual GTI values.

ðŸ“Š Key Insights

Time-based patterns (hour of day, season) significantly enhance predictive power.
Strongest feature correlations include ghi_pyr_1, ghi_pyr_2, and dhi_pyr.
Residual errors are well-distributed, indicating unbiased performance.

âœ… 1. MAE â€“ Mean Absolute Error
MAE: 8.64
What it means: On average, the model's predictions are off by about 8.64 W/mÂ².

If gti_clean values typically range between 0â€“1000 W/mÂ², an error of 8.64 is quite small (~1%).

The model is reasonably accurate in predicting solar irradiance.

âœ… 2. RMSE â€“ Root Mean Squared Error
RMSE: 17.74
What it means: Similar to MAE, but penalizes larger errors more heavily.

It helps detect outliers or occasional large mistakes.

RMSE > MAE suggests there are some larger deviations, but overall performance is still solid.

âœ… 3. RÂ² Score â€“ Coefficient of Determination

Copy
Edit
RÂ² Score: 0.9975
What it means: 99.75% of the variability in solar irradiance is explained by the modelâ€™s input features.

A perfect model would have RÂ² = 1.0.

The model is capturing the major patterns in the data very well.

ðŸ“Š Visual Aids in the Notebook:

Actual vs Predicted Plot

Points close to the diagonal line mean accurate predictions.

A tight, linear pattern confirms high RÂ².

Residual Distribution Plot

If residuals are centered around zero and roughly normal, it means the model's errors are unbiased and well-distributed.

Correlation Heatmap & Feature Plots

Helps validate that important weather features (like GHI, temperature, etc.) have strong relationships with GTI.

ðŸŽ¯ Overall Evaluation:
Your Random Forest model shows:

High accuracy

Low prediction error

Robust performance even with variability in weather
